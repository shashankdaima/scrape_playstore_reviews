While calculating fare or checking route between I.P. extn. and Delhi gate shortest root, app has a bug and it crashes everytime and closes, asks to clear the Cache of the device. Other routes may be affected for the same, but not checked. If required can s.hare the screen shot for the same
Nearest metro station is stupidest button. Useless. I don't want to check from my location. No option to put location in the app. 3rd class app
DMRC need to check the bug in their app. Until validity of one ticket, you can't book other ticket, in my case when I book return ticket popup come "you allready have active ticket please use it before generate new ticket" and that ticket i allready used. I talk to station master he told me take ticket from counter. It will not booked.
Very helpful for people who need instant metro route and also for ones that are not good with reading map lines
Pretty detailed app, much appreciated. The only problem is the recharge of metro card which fails everytime. Delhi metro should really make it easier to topup cards online or visa upi. It's too much hassle at the moment.
1. "First and Last Metro" section is showing error for more than 2 weeks and now under Updation. Do you understand the importance of services provided for some reason. Which is lacking for such a long time. Pls! Resolve it ASAP. 2. App is not very quick/instant to show Route. Loading makes us feel like using old laaging Phone. Pls! Look into response time of App.
Last version was very good.. It takes more time and need internet connectivity... Older version was simple and best.. Now i uninstalled this app.
Better make a wallet system in which customer could add amount and then can scan the QR code at station which will deduct the amount according to the travel at destination. Min balance could be 10 rupees and in case balance is low, will display low balance message and not allow the entry/exit. Addon of checking best route according to time/money was good.
One important thing you should add is that which side of the train the doors will open. That will be more convenient to the users. Thanks.
It is a very bad app, if you book tickets, the money would have been deducted, but the tax code does not come, brothers, do not use this app.

Aqua line stations are not updated in this app. But this app is good to navigate through metro.
Finding your platform on metro stations sure is a pain. The app makes everything really easy. The only thing is that sometimes the route shown in the app might be the one where you have to change stations more than an alternative route but that doesn't really increase any cost and if you travel regularly, finding alternative routes won't be tough
Super App work, i helped a lot during in metro
Worst experience after update. The app takes very much time to navigate the rute between stations. And always buffering. It even doesn't shows the first and the last timing of the qutub minar.üò†üò†
what's the benifit of service allert ‚ö†Ô∏è, As it's not updated either during delayed in blueline many times also.
This is very good app for people and very supportive everyone can use it easily government is doing great work for the people Modi government is very best government
Very Simple to use.. This app makes easier for the tourists to visit places in Delhi üëåüôèüèª
This is the worst app i missed my exam due to this app interchange of metro is missing in this map wordt app
Everything this working even in offline mode but I would suggest you guys to please add language options
I could have given ratings in minus if possible. I was traveling dwarka to Sikandarpur for a interview, it showed shortest route via Rajeev chowk. One off my co-pasanger guided me to change the line at rajouri garden, which will save my atleast 40 minutes. And it worked. Poor ratings for misguiding and incomplete details.

Very small font, directions are not clear... Useless
Great job with the update.! But After I select my destination, and the app shows the route, please put an option of 'Choose some other route' Suppose, I am going from Station A to B. I might have a particular route in mind. But the app shows only two routes - shortest and with minimum interchanges. So, if I want to take a route different from these 2, I don't get any info about it. (The tickets, interchanges, fare etc). There should be an option to select other metro lines for the route.
The latest build looks awesome. Everything under one roof. The loading time may have got increased by some seconds.
It does not show the platform number which we are supposed to take while changing to a different line. Other than that the app is perfect.
Awesome UI and detailed information. Update*: I think instead of launching a new app for QR ticket generation, that feature should have added to this app. Why are you leaving this app useless.
Very bad experience. My card was not working. I have shown it on the token counter but there was no solution. My balance was above 200 which is totally finished.
Very poor app . Works very slow old version was far better . This version is good for nothing just colourful interface and nothing.
Everything is good about this app, but the Route after the completion of Pink Line between Trilokpuri and Mayur Vihar Pocket I has yet not been updated since 2 months. Because of this I was so confused as I am new to Delhi Metro. So, please update it soon.
The earlier version gave details of all the routes available and one could choose as per their convenience. It was a helpful feature. Now it only shows one recommended route. There is no option to even pick the different route and check how much time it will take. Please bring back that feature.
There was just no need to update the previous version. The best thing about that was its simplicity and ease to use. This version, in an attempt to provide more info and stylish look, has made this app worse. I had been using that version for so long and had just no complaints with it. Please revert to previous version or I'll have no option but to switch to some other app.

The Delhi Metro Rail app by Delhi Metro Rail Corporation is a true lifesaver for commuters in the city. It provides real-time information on train schedules, station details, and even offers route planning, making my daily commute a breeze. The intuitive interface ensures a smooth user experience, and the accuracy of the updates is impressive. This app is an essential companion for anyone navigating the Delhi Metro system, and it has greatly simplified my travel routine. Highly recommended!
Old version was better and fast and it worked offline. I would be better if offline mode is available in latest version.
All metro stations not available in this app
Its very convenient.. Very helpful app. You can just type your source and destination. It tells us shortest route, travel time, fare, number of stations and interchange between source to destination.
Disappointed with the pathetic application. Wasted 1 hour due to application glitch.
The app is definitely very useful someone new to the metro culture but has some flaws which you get to know about when you get used to this culture of metro. Like it will show many unnecessary interchange at various stations but will definitely take you there. Accuracy is 100 percent but the route shown is a bit longer or shows more interchanges.
The app works perfect for even the odd ones out
New Update sucks and was not needed. I understand a lot of people are using this app but the people who need this most are not that tech savvy. They just need a light weight, simple app that can show them the route. You can make a separate app for advanced users if you want. Please reverse the UI back to the previous one. Thanks.
This new app is taking too long time to respond and on the show route and fare page, only route is showing. In the previous version, it is also showing how much distance in KMs and how many total stations with count are there in between two stations but in new version it is not showing. Kindly update accordingly.
Appreciate the new update! Much better experience and hasn't crashed yet. UI is slightly overcomplicated - such as the date and time picker when you just want to find routes. If it could be less disruptive with the service unavailable popup, would be great. Love to see how the team actually listened to user issues

Superb APP, one stop guide for Delhi Metro.
This app is not so helpful, because many information are wrong.
I used this app at least 1 year and it's good with no glitch üòå
This is very good apps those are new in Delhi and didn't know about anything of metro rail of Delhi. So this app is very helpful and useful for guidance
Previous version was accurate and time saving. In this version route between stations showing totally inaccurate, like on blue line from Shadipur to Vaishali which is a direct route on the same blue line and no need of interchange , App shows a VERY VERY LONG route through red line and other lines which takes 73 minutes ???? Overall this version is fully misleading at least for new commuters and some how for old ones too. My suggestion is remove this version and keep previous version.
The old virson was very easy and fast working.... You have to thing about it otherwise many people will switch to alternative
Overall good app. Must include following points:- 1. Recent Searched routes to included for easy selection rather than typing a same station name again. 2. Route Options should be mention in as an icon all the times while viewing route. (like Google Maps) 3. While searching station ask for date. As on some line services start on different times in view of working or non working days. 4. Always show first and last service time of that date from origin and return from destination.
New update of app is very bad previous version was good light weighted and designed was good with color map while search. This version has improved map but searching is very slow and in previous version we can click on station to search but now we can't. Something called beta testing please do this before any update thanks. I know the pressure on developing team.
The UI/UX revamp was a much needed update. Though th new app is stuck on the loading screen when connected to the internet. In offline mode it launches instantly. please look into that. Another feature request: allow us to pick start and end station on the interactive map, to get route details.
The new version is too complex and far less appealing than the one earlier. Why did the DMRC team not understand that the only thing required in that version was multi lingual interface and not Revamping of the entire design The new version actually does not deserve even one star but due to rating one is what is lowest. DMRC also forgot that there are other metro's with which it integrates that one is totally missing now Then the funny map and too rigid graphics cum interface

The previous version is much better than the new one, now only able to see one map and have to zoom to check where to interchange. Not only this. Previous it is just one click and able to recharge my card online. But now they have removed from the home screen
The old version was way better. Earlier there were two options, a written chart of the route (and interchanges) and a map. In the new update, I can only see the metro route on the Map. The written chart is easier to use. Please bring it back.
Really disappointed, Please get back the previous version or download everything in this app offline,. It's not work online and it's either not shown any single thing that i want to check, In the previous version it was so easy to find anything but now there is so many bugs and it's endlessly slow
After Updating DMRC app now feels like the IRCTC app. without an updated app version familiar. The new route map is different from the route map at the metro station. This version requires internet whereas older. Convenient for youth engaged in internet but very difficult for senior citizens and first-time users of metro service. only change graphics are required in the old version. Single Star for The detailed information about the metro station is very good.
The app is great and helps a lot in navigating the metro system. However, it would be great if there are real-time updates about any delay on any of the routes of the metro lines. Been stuck at Rajiv Chowk station for last 15 minutes without any knowledge of why or for how long.
There was not much need for this new interface. Especially the map in this new interface is not good and not real. The previous map was best and the app was also simple to use; search results were quick. Please look into this.
Lot of improvement needed. Some suggestions as a Tech entrepreneur. Make use of location service of mobile. So that it detects nearest station easily, where user is standing. Also option of choosing manually. Which is already there. So that's not a problem.
Always I found the app dull and with Inaccurate data. The latest app has changed my opinion completely the time I updated and new version was displayed. What beautiful colour combination and amazing presentation of details inside. Hats off to the team for developing such a beautiful and user friendly app. Three cheers to DMRC team keep it up.
App design is good, map feature is not upto the mark, it needs to zoomed in, rather it should focus on searched stations critaria. After that user can zoom out to see complete metro network. Station alert feature also not working. Station alert should also work in background.
The new UI is good, but the app is unusable now. It is stuck on an endless loading screen. It has been on the loading screen for 3 hours now. EDIT: Increased the rating to 5. They fixed all the issues. It's a great app now.

After today's update this app crashing again and again whenever I try to plan a journey and search the stations it simply closed each time. When I try to submit feedback it show some error for a second saying "your phone is not connected to data service" something Hope you will resolve the issue soon.
The ability to drop a pin between two stations, as in the previous version, could make the map more interactive. It would be really fantastic to be able to recharge metro cards without being directed to an ugly website.
This new version is not good very disappointing.. The old version was best.. With the old version its very easy to find the metro station, inter changes etc but with the new version it's very difficult and very very confusing specially for the new users. It will be great if old version comes back
Bring back the old app this new version doesn't work and is needlessly clunky same station repeated two times can't even see the map without entering a route and it's doesnt even take routes most of the times just crashes after entering .... I don't know how this new stupid app got past testing ...
Today the app only provides a single route between two stations. Can you add the functionality by which I can choose the interchange station. For example to go to ‡§¨‡§¶‡§∞‡§™‡•Å‡§∞ from Huda City center, the app provides interchange at haus khas and then kalkaji mandir. I think the walk between lines in kalkaji is to long. But the app does not give the facility to see the route if I want to change at central secretariat
There was no need to update the whole app. The older version was good and it's working was smooth . This update is time consuming , and the DMRC metro map is also not smooth. If possible , Bring back the older version with important update .
It was very good before this update. Many good features removed. And most importantly it is not doing its main work ie to show route between stations. Whenever i fill the stations, date and time and click ok the app freezes and closes. Fix this asap...
I really love this app. It's give me all the information I need while travelling along with that it's also provide me the nearest metro station from my location. However, GUI is not good enough but over all it provides me all features which I want like feeder services, parking available, station information etc.
No long review everything works fine... interface of the app is excellent...it's only one request from my side that you should add an another facility to check out metro card balance in the phone app....sometimes it makes sense if we had a facility to check the balance at home...please update and add this option if it can happen
In comparison, previous version was much more user friendly n it's interface was very simple n good. New one is very very slow n has no such quality, the previous version had. Only updation was required without changing the interface.
===
The new update is horrible, please switch back to the old version. Everyone liked the old version because of how simple and easy it was to use, but now it is impossible to use this app so difficult to navigate and can't find the first train timings for Sunday, such a horrible updated version
This app is useful but misleading. For instance, I searched the time from Bahadurgarh to Dhaula Kuan, it showed 67 minutes but it took us 3 hours to reach there. Functionalities like First Train Time, Last Train time are useful. but the routes it shows are really misleading. Also the interchange time on stations is too long nowadays.
Every time it helps me. Especially this app is more helpfull for those who are living outside delhi , for old aged, for those delhi people who still faces problem in switching amoung blue line to yellow to red etc. Personally i used this app last time and it works well . it also work without internet connection. Before this, i used many apps but they did not provide right info regarding platform, route etc. But this app is worth to use. Go for it , if you also faces kind of problem .
The app is very good, but please make some difference in App's DMRC Network Information page, between normal stations and station with intetchange, so anyone can easily find out Interchange station. Before current update there was a different types of arrow for normal station and interchange station. It was very convenient. I am not a resident of Delhi, but I like DMRC App. Thank you.
This is the best application as a Metro commuter. Any person coming in Delhi must install. The UI can be polished a lot. That's the only drawback. The regular updates for all the lines makes it great. Also if I could get the option to recharge via the app itself, it would be great.
There are lot of errors in this updated version. I'm not able to search any route in this. It force closes, lag, asking again and again to re-enter station details. And then keep searching without giving any detail of route. Plz check before releasing updates
The options in finding route are not working for me ! And its better to remove the options and rather name them 'route via yello line' or 'route via pink line' or whatever. It says option1 or option2. And when selecting starting point and destination, it automatically suggests the route whether it's wanted or not. This is also not necessary. Let the user choose where he wants to reach and from which line. I was looking for the route today. It didn't show what i expected. Please update these.
This was a really a much needed update. Your Real Time route suggestions and Line Status are really helpful. I also tried Station Alert feature yesterday that was simply amazing and supremely useful. The app notified me about arrival of my destination, while I had my headphones plugged in and couldn't hear the announcements in the coach. Like always, Delhi Metro Rail Corporation is up to its known standards of excellence. There were some hiccups in your first version, but when I cleared my storage and reinstalled the app it truly changed my opinion. Now I can use the app Offline as well as Online. I must mention that your website is also super se uper. These new updates are a big and bold step towards Digital India. I hope you will bring more features and allow us to recharge cards through the same app. Keep it up.
This app is really important for the people who want to use Delhi Metro, but sadly, the app is not at all upto the mark. It is really slow and not at all user-friendly. They have shown the routes in a complicated way. Better, we search for the routes on Google or ask a representative on the desk.
I was loving the previous version. The new one is confusing and don't need that much features .. honestly saying . Keep it light and interface clean . Will support till you bring it to the level.

Metro Service is outstanding but the app is very old fashioned and not designed in proper manner. Not at all user friendly. Every time user has to login to recharge your card, login page opens DMRC web page that takes to much time to load rather than opening a small app page, login page zoom in/out is not available on app, enter user id and password, no biomatric login as it is supported on smart phones with finger print scanners. Rest of the features are good but missing many features like if Metro museum ticket is there, we should be able to purchase ticket from this app itself. We also should be able to buy tokens from the app which can be shown to the counter at the metro station and get tokens so need not to wait for longer time.
Best application, I loved it. from tourism spots to ticket fair, Route information, transit stations everything available... If u have this app, u don't need to spend much money on bus, taxi, auto. its enough to find a shortest Metro line and u can enjoy with a good traveling experience...
No Updates on pink line route. They claim, but there is no update on the pink line route. It still shows disconnect between Mayur vihar and Trilok Puri 27 Feb 2022 Post new update, even the route between 2 stations feature is also not working. It is the most useful feature and that too is defunct now. 20June22 App is not updating. 3 attempts failed to update.
The app has gotten very slow recently. Also, you need to add the fare for travelling by card, and for special hours. You should also, show which gate at a particular station leads towards which important places. Other third party apps already have these features.
The app is ultra slow. It does not load and doesn't open easily. It takes ages to calculate the route. Fails to serve the purpose. Previous version of app was quick and very useful.
This application is a must have for everyone, except if they live somewhere on the new aqua line. It doesn't contain any information about the new line and this results in passengers relying on Google Maps info which is usually disastrous already.
This app is almost perfect. Routes are sometimes shown longer while there are other shorter options available. DO NOT RELY ON THE TIME SHOWN ON THIS APP. its completely wrong. need to work on this.
Very very slow, Whenever will try to open, will buffer be first then open. Old version Very fast and minimum information but was good. Now is many information not understand in first look and very slow. please need to improve .It should be usee friendly. I am not happy in this new version.
It will be good if DMRC update the aqua line route from Noida sector 52.. overall the app is good and very helpful specially for those who are arriving in Delhi for the first time.
How pathetic the app has become. It was way more easier to find routes, maps and metro lines in the previous version. Don't confuse metro with indian railway, Both are different. Please roll back to the previous version.

This app is helpful, no doubt! But it sure has some room for improvement too; the developer should take into account that there are various routes within metro to reach from one destination to another and this app should GIVE OPTIONS LIKE 1) SHORTEST/ FASTEST ROUTE 2) LEAST INTERCHANGE 3) LESS CROWDED (Depending on timing) Thanks.
Please revert to the earliet app version. The earlier version had a better search engine. Also I found the map was not accurate with the route and direction of metro and placement of metro stations.
UI is good but the app isn't doing for what it's actually build to do. Route search feature isn't working, First and Last metro timing option is also taking a lot of time to search. Add recharge smart card option in app.
The app only provides information which is static in nature. Except for Station Location and Station Alert, the information does not change very often and as such onc accessed , it need not be access by user. It is suggested that Smart Card Recharge facility be incorporated in the app along with facility to view balance/unused amount available in Smart Card.
Aqua Line is missing. Unnecessarily Longer Routes are shown. Please optimize the routes. Why will someone want to interchange thrice for a destination that can be reached with a single interchange. I don't recommend this application to find routes.
The app was very good until I searched for route from saket to pari chowk. It did not show me any route, but because "Aqua Line" has been started now then it must show the route maybe not directly but the interchangeable route. I got another app which helped me in this matter and showed me indirect route between saket and pari chowk. My suggestion is Kinldly update the app ASAP because competition is great and you have to be better than others always to be in the market. Thank you.
I love the update. Just a little minor inconvenience when searching for RK Puram, can you please add a space between RK and Puram, as it's currently R.K.PURAM, and searching for RK with a space does not list this station! Me and my friends have faced the same issue, so I think others might also face this while searching for this station. Not really a major concern, still wanted to point out! Thanks for the app!
It used be best metro app but after new UI not anymore Specially the searching is laggy..most probably due to searching on main thread or did not add delay after 3 letters during search. Old app was so much smoother. I think the main features in any metro app are searching, maps, routes
The experience is very horrible. Speed of app is very slow. The older version was very nice, easy to use, quick operating app. I don't think it will work. I am going to uninstall.
Awesome app. Have been using it since 2017. Handy app when you want to know about metro. It would be great if they can add options for choosing your metro route. And then calculate time.

Please fix to its older version, the way it used to show route in simpler manner. Why it is showing in such way. Those who are new to Delhi won't understand that new version of map. Please just show the stations and routes like the way it was before.
Thanks DMRC It Was My 1st Travelling With Delhi Metro And It Was Impossible Without This Amazing App
pathatic and amateurish. travel time highly unreliable. seems that the developer did not even make the effort to actually measure the actual time. time of changing platforms not considered. if you plan to take a metro to the airport or railway stations', don't believe the time indicated, you will surely miss your flight / train recharge facility most unreliable and difficult to use. route between stations, shows the most complicated route with maximum number of interchange.
This new version is too slow. And requires internet to work. Previous version was way better. It was capable to give station, route info real quick and did not need any internet connection to work.
First and last metro timing is not available. It always show "this section is under updation"
Nice app for metro routing . A suggestion: the location search option should allow planning a journey from a certain place and search nearby located metro stations without physically being present there would be an added advantage/feature for the planned travellers.
After recent update on 6th june with latest version its taking 60 seconds to check metro route earlier it use to take just 5 to 10 seconds...useless app old app of metro was good..either improve or provide older version...why same issue again and again also dont send updates without checking at ur end.why ur technical team is not able to resolve such small problem..still taking 60 secs
This app is not giving all possible routes between origin and destination. It give limited choices and generally routes are long. Other apps giving all possible routes which saves lot of time. Even though this is official DMRC app..
The updated version is not at all good. We need to zoom in the map to see the exact station and different routes are also messed up. The previous version was way better than this one.
Older Version of the app was quite Amazing and Easy to use . Mainly the metro map was Very Outstanding . But this new Version is inconvenient for most of the users. I request to please Update for new version and combine older version features also in next update. PLEASE

This upgraded almost non-functional App, is a waste of time. It may take a while to get stabilsed. Better many a times was the earlier version. It doesn't match the Delhi Metro standards, poor show !
Very useless update, the old version was better than this and this new update is causing a lot of buffering. The map is not opening while checking the route and since the day the app has been updated, this app has worked today. DMRC please fix this.
While it has an occasional hiccup here and there, but overall functionality is good. Why does it need location permission? Want to spy on users or what? I see many negative reviews for not adding Aqua line. Are those people so ignorant that they don't even know Aqua line is under NMRC (Noida Metro) and NOT DMRC. However, it makes sense to include or at least have an option for Aqua line, but DMRC is completely in their rights to NOT list it in their app, and correctly so.
They need to fix this issue that is after clicking on tour guide app there is not appearing places which is used to appear
It's a great app for knowing metro routes & tolen pricing...where to interchange...also it shows different routes (if available) for similar destination...I personally like it & use it quite often whenever I have to go to the new place..
When search the route between two station, app does not tell from which platform to catch the train. When you click the platform, it shows both the platforms. Even after sharing the problem deatils, reluctant to acknowledge the shortcoming and no response.
The version prior to the UI revamp was better. It was quick with station selection as well as route display. The new UI looks cluttered and is quite slow.
old version was good that version was very cool and ligh. After update Take to much time to open app buffering and buffering problem take too much time to show results. Please, for the convenience of the passengers, you should kindly resolve the problem of discussion with your higher authority.
Same user friendliness as before. Much needed GUI interface improvements. However it should display the route as default view instead of the map, after we've entered the origin & destination stations.
The station information is not accessible and displays that the app has stopped working. It's very annoying. Not useful at all during emergencies.

It's an useful app to find the route you have to travel and the fare for the same. The best feature which i think is the complete information about every station like entry & exit gates.
New version is very slow. Previous was much better, user friendly and easy to use and light weight. New version does not even let show route easily.
New UI/UX is amazing, but app is crashing a lot and often. Specially at the time of planning of route. Also kindly add a feature to see metro map without any selection of stations.
Don't bother to recharge your smart card through the app or through the website. The payment gateways don't work. The ICICI one doesn't work and the PayTM one works but doesn't give you a confirmation for the transaction. So it basically takes your money which doesn't reach DMRC, so you cannot raise a complain. ü§¨
This app is not working properly. Not showing the station route and interchange point. Previous app was too good and easy. Its also taking time to load the information. Also, Destination Arrival Alert didn't worked.
Please roll back your updated application. It is slow and complicated. No fare and time is integrated.please roll back this version. New map create bad image of dmrc instead of old map which is likely to more understandable.
It has gone bad with new update today. It is giving no net banking recharge option at stage of selecting bank.
The new UI is okay but the map has changed a lot it's not possible to see it clearly on phone. The previous version had so many route options. Now there's just two e.g if I want to go from Chandni chowk to Anand Vihar ISBT i could chose to travel to rajeev chowk and change from there to the metro towards Vaishali. But now it shows two options only one through red line and the second one goes like straight to INA then change via Pink line. It's just RUBBISH
The app is really slow.
First and last metro option is always under updation

There is no details of aqua line in it please update it as early you can
It's really good for those travel first time in Delhi Metro üöá
no logical routing, and the estimated time is always shown less than actual time, which will make you late for your errands. Please take into calculation the time at interchange stations, and also give the best logical route according to that.. routing seriously needs to be improved with options of different routes and respective route times.
It started working fine post updating it a few times. This version is better and more informative, especially the platform numbers to be taken while boarding or interchanging. Good update.
I don't why it keeps loading. The homepage or dashboard does not open. It keeps loading. I have good internet speed. Website is loading. But old app was fast, this keeps loading. I don't know if it is happening only with my device or all.
Horrible application. It shows you Total number of stations it will cover including th interchange. But on interchange which metro to board for the destination???? Like I took a metro from Dwarka to Dilli hat INA. On the interchange it was showing me 4 different platforms reaching my location. How can 4 different metros from different platforms reach the same destination that I selected? Also the 4 platforms weren't showing their route post interchange which misleads Please fix this bug asap
As you like so you do the best.provide for public convenience .As better
The online recharge experience is extremely bad on a mobile phone. It opens a big recharge page which is unusable. This experience is the reason why you are loosing customers to apps like paytm, phonepe.
After searching route, it takes time to show result, previously the result used to show very quickly
App is great but needs an update as it doesn't have aqua line route map in it

It's Izzy to use and Izzy check it out your destination and near by Metro Station , rail way .ü§óü§óüòäüòÅ
Very poor service at green line one can think is he travelling by Indian railways not by any metro. Time table is for disply only not to follow.
Many stations are not even updated in the app. Useless.
Would wish if they add an option for real time tracking of metros
Great App. Love the fact that it has no ads too.
Previous update is far better than this easy to understand and very minimalistic for previous update i give 4 star and for this 1.5
After update some metro station is not showing in app like "Huda City centre"..‚Ä¶
Everything is so clear and easy to understand. UI contains so much functionality which help us to recharge the card, locate the train, find map two stations and find nearest metro station from our houses..
Slow app, need to fix it up with glucose. First and last train timing is the most used feature, which doesn't seems to work at all. Metro should prepare a pdf chart and put it on website.
Overall experience with App is great. I have one observation and suggestion. Station Alert feature needs attention of App developer. At present this feature is giving no station alert to App user.

Although the app is useful, sometimes it shows wrong route and that can be a real problem if you are with kids and have luggage. I had put dhansa bus stand as destination from new delhi railway station, it asked me to take orange route first. When I went with all my luggage and 2 kids the tokens did not work. The guy told that tokens don't work here. Luckily he suggested to take the yellow line to Rajiv chowk and then change from there.
Unable to search huda .. its showing nothing in new update. üòîüòî
This new UI and fresh look is very good now works smooth and fast but only things is that when we search the route between stations that time it takes time but overall it is far more better than the previous one and updates are getting faster so overall very good
Please rollback. New layout app crashes everytime I try to find a route. In cases where it doesn't crash, it goes into infinite loading state with no back pressing allowed.
This version is pathetic at least in previous version app was quite responsive but in this version ( fare calculator, show route and fare) both of these are not responding when ever I click on them they just buffer.
New version is pretty better but.. It overall user interface experience is poor. It lags, old version was just flawless in its own kind. Kindly make that version available too on playstore.
Why was the UI butchered? Slow animations and less information is served with this update. Also, the map design is misleading and the app can use another overhaul to fix everything that is broken now.
1. Metro line are now Black and Gray. 2. App needs internet to see Metro Map. 3. Offline routes checking is easy and convenient in case internet is slow or not available. 4. Not everybody want live updates. So selecting time is useless then. 5. App is so slow. I am disappointed with DMRC Team now. Make things user friendly. Life is already complex.
Earlier version of this app was best and easy to use but this version is worse. I used to use that app from so long time but since when this version came I m fed up. Kindly downgrade the app to its previous version. Else I have to uninstall it. I don't have another option hence giving you one star else nothing can be given for this.
I really wanted the app to revamp, but actually now you have worsen it, it's stuck on loading, and keep on loading only, doesn't show any result. Earlier it used to offline as well, but now it doesn't work anytime

The new update has so many issues.On every search there is very much letiancy and it takes around 5 minutes to show the data. It seems the developer has not tested it well.
It's really SLOW...takes alot of time for most of the things to do.. like services options..fare calculation and everything elseüòê Although app has many other related information but it seems it's not well optimised.
The app is really good and of great help.The only problem is that it does not show to which side's metro we have to choose (eg like samaypur badli or huda city) and everytime we have to go and check it on the map.
Very poor optimizations and no help system or feedback for the payments for the cards. I got my money deducted two times and nothing was on my screen only white. I had ro contact the customer support for that.
This version is too slow to load, route search results must show list of in between stations, search results should be zoomed on map also. Features are good but need alot improvement.
This app is as good as dmrc's services. Extremely horrible, long, confusing routes when clearly a short alternative route exists. 10/10 would never recommend this app to anyone. You are better off using Google to find route.
After recent update, it's not working even on proper network. Route info and guidance was better earlier but now it's confusing. UI feels slow. Needs improvement.
Roll back your update as this slow and shity. Previous version was easy to use and faster. This version doesn't even get opened. It keeps on buffering.
App is good and easy to use .But i found that unnecessary longer routes are being showed in place of easy and shorter routes . Please optimise the routes so that it can be easy , time and money saving .
Best experience with the app. All of the features is good. But search bar need to be upgrade because when we need to enter proper spelling and we'll station name.

There is no Bank selection option available in App seems very useless App
Very helpful Good app for travelling in metro daily easily see in app each metro station tourist spots and parking , life and escalators , platforms , first and last train timings , gate & Directions & also available see in this app feeder services are available or not and also gayen in this app separatedly Tour Guide & online recharge your metro card by using this app. Any destination you select app mark in metro map in continuosely root and also available your nearest metro station feature .
All in all a good app to use. A little low on features. Some features, like knowing nearest station from address, don't always work.
This updated version is so bad. It doesn't show any route, fare. Actually nothing. Whenever try to find out the route is keeps coming back to the home page.
I was on a short Delhi visit and had no idea about routes and timing but this app helped me a lot and made all my journeys easy and hustle free. The best thing of this app is that internet is not mandatory. If you are not from Delhi and clueless about metro then this app is highly recommend.
The older version worked lightning fast. The new UI has made the app slow. Plus station names have now become case sensitive, which is an unnecessary headache. Poor update.
Simple and easy to use previous version has been replaced with sluggish new version. Unnecessary update, and degradation in performance.
Earlier there was an option of online B tickets, now it is not
The delhi metro app showed me route which included changing stations with violet line . The journey was from Kashmiri gate to Chhattarpur metro station and the app showed me route passing from violet line . I'm surprised to see when the easier option to go with yellow line is available, when is it that I am being presented with less viable option ?
Please roll back this update... It takes much more time to start-up Much more time to finds station and also take a lots of time to find the route...! If u are able to fix that all bugs...so pls go ahead ASAP. otherwise give back the older version.i'm happy with that... Pls. rollback these updates....!!!

Pathetic. You do not need user's photo and media permissions. Also this new update doesn't work at all. PATHETIC. Please revert to prior version. EDIT 1. THE APP OFFICIALS HAVE FORTHWITH COMPLIED AND CORRECTED THE DEFAULTS. BIG SHOUT OUT TO THEM FOR PROMPTNESS. KUDOS AND THANKS FOR THE SWEET GESTURE!!!
Never come on time time pink line, worst service
Previous app was great. We just have to open map and click on stations unlike now first scroll up and down search then u will get the information for particular route. It is worst experience. Sorry DMRC but please give us previous version.
Doesn't show alternate/shorter route. Only shows one route that's longer e.g. Badarpur to Barakhamba. Other apps show all possible routes. Otherwise it's a more detailed app.
Badly made app with low functionality. You have to know the exact name of the station and can't search for it. Learn from apps such as Transport for London. There are already some independent apps for Delhi metro that are far better. Use those.
The new UI update is a breath of fresh air. However it has taken away the basic functionality. It takes forever to load the routes. Please look into it
Aqua line is not showing in routes.. please update
New version is not good . It takes too much time to response and metro map is so messy but old version was too good to use and time saving.
Nice app, with all relevant informations. But the problem with this app is , we have to take help from another sources for knowing the stations of aqua line. Though aqua line falls under NMRC, I request the developers to include aqua line stations in this app too.
Route zoom,route on google and if we planning a journey we should get status of metro running at that time otherwise there is no use of that option. There should separate section where we recharge card and check available balance on card.

Tour Guide function in the app is not working
The earlier version used to process very slowly. This version is much much faster than that. It gives the desired result in the blink of an eye. I think all people have this experience, if so then comment.
Please bring the old metro map back....the new one is really bad and far away from the real metro route design... The app is also slow and takes forever to load.
Totally helpful. After this update the app has been working so good i mean everything is very clr now any prsn who is traveling alone or for first time and have this app will never go on wrong line or station . Telling each n everything true and fast . Thank you so much Delhi Metro Rail for this helpful application . Grateful for you üôÇ
The app of you people is very good, but if you tell the platform number in it, then this app can give very good facilities, so show the platform from which you want to sit in it, the rest of its real time also.And which station is near it, it also shows it, so you can improve your facilities.
The app is not showing the right route for Pink Line users though full Pink Line is opened months ago. DMRC used to be leading METRO in India but it is failure to not update the app the day the changes in Network are implemented. Why is it not considered important to update the app, it appears passengers are least important though paying fare.
The whole UI overhaul is sleek & apt to access lot of services. If there is an option to recharge the metro card, it will be great. Let's see it in the future version ‚ò∫Ô∏è.
Just started using it. Found useful and it should be as it is from DMRC. Only problem I found is that routes and fares are not updated.It should happen on realtime basis as and when new routes are launched and fares are revised.
Very useful App...i was travel Delhi few days ago.. this app help me a lot....üòçüòç
The latest version of the app crashes everytime I have to see fares between 2 station....the old app was working fine.....i always update the app regularly...still same problem.

This version of app does not include Huda City Centre station please look into this issue.
Good Excellent navigation , mostly provide best way to travel, option to exit gate , timing of train , parking availability in metro station , metro timing of first train , last train also provide , washrooms availability at metro station , visiting places in delhi with best routes , i always use this app to go different places in delhi.
Very good guidance
Very useful for people who are not acquainted with routes. Just make the processing time faster
Useless update. I mean it was good before very simple to use but now the update just crashes. It feels like you have tried to make it look good but the purpose of user friendliness is gone.
All details about Delhi Metro is available in this app. Details about routes, fares, stations,metro lines, parking, escalator, lift, platform. Only minus point in this app is app doesn't provide daily updates or current issues regarding metro service..
The app is trash, doesn't even show the route, waiting for 5 whole minutes but it's still loading. Might as well look at the map manually and determine the route by ourselves smh.
The app has become useless after update, it keeps on browsing once we open the app, much complicated than the previous one, regretting after updating the app, plz make the information clear and simple.
this app is made by govt bodies but it is not updated regularly. other private apps show new routes and maps as soon the commute begins but this app fails to deliver the updated routes even after months.
Very slow app. The interface is good but whenever I press Back from any page, it takes hours to get back to home page. Very Slow

Don't know why you chose to make the apl worse....while it was just perfect.... please revert to the previous version....update is quite horrible....no so user-friendly have to look up things while in previous version everything you needed to know was right in front of your eyes..... please do something about it
Previous one was much better , if someone who is new in delhi NCR and he wants to knew about from which platform he has take metro for that person this application is useless , If anyone set a route then application should also give platform information that from which platform the person has to take metro and also provide information about interchange platform as well.
I wish interface would have been user friendly with screen readers, as it is not the case I started using Google maps as it is easier to use with talkback.
useful app for occasional metro users like me. routes are up to date. on-line recharge of smart cards can be made more user friendly. i recharged for 200, but it was not reflected in my card
App UI is updated and looks great, but issue with the search of station name. The search is not case-sensitive. Please update.
Nice and Useful app. Very helpful in locating routes through metro. Also developers if you could add Aqua line Stations in the next update would be very helpful.
Older Version was Faster and Better. Reducing from 4 to 2 Star for poor performance of new version of app. Please also add an option to check and update Smart Metro Card Balance through this app. This is very much needed....
Not user friendly. In one go earlier app was showing all relevant details like time, km, stations etc. I can't understand what has been upgraded. Needs total review.
One more update and it's still crashing. Can you bring back older version. We don't care about fancy user interface.
App doesn't crash anymore. But the UI/UX is still not good. Previous version was better and user friendly.

The app has become worse. After update, features have been added but takes so long to show data. It's really has gotten worse.
Please provide PLATFORM NUMBER alongwith station names on the metro routes. It will help people who are not frequent flier. We always wonder for the train at the metro station because panel shows only last station of that route. Therefore, we always asking at the station that YEH METRO THIS OR THAT par jayegi. By adding PLATFORM NUMBER we will just board the train and move toward our destination.
The older version was much better and had a simpler interface. This one is a little complicating and there was no need to change the look of the app.
Amazing experience. User friendly. This app made my stay in delhi very easy, just enter the start and end location, it will give you the complete route, time and fare. Kudos to Delhi metro team.
the interface has changed, which is good. but the application crashes every time we search the route.
Updated version is too slow. It shows only buffering buffering and buffering nothing else. Please solve this problem as soon as possible.
Since the new update, it has been damn slow. The menu opens up only after a minute or two on an SD 870 chipset.
App crashing, unable to find, ux is very bad only design good, please revert back old classic app, it is fast and perfect or put it to light version.
The app is overall good and it helps a lot. But the only thing is it has a wrong timing information for the starting time of Metro on Sundays.
Older version is very simple and good.You get all information in one click. But, in this verison. It always take time to search. Which I think tardy and time taking.

Please rollback the update. This one is slow and more complex thand the previous one. Also there is some issue with the map when we zoom in.
After the update. It's of no use in low end devices. Very disappointed. It's takes so much time to load and on the contrary it doesn't load most of the times.
application is all together very good but tha main issue is tha the aqua line is not yet added to the application so kindly look on to that and add the new metro routes as soon as possible.
Really BAD and SLOW. This app was really good before the update. Now it's just pure bad. It used to be really quick, now all you do is stare at the screen while it tries to load simple stuff. Do not recommend. It could not have been worse.
Metro app is very good .. no adds .. quite useful .. but they haven't updated the route on pink line and fair prices üòÖüòÖ.what a waste. Therefore cross-check information with their website.
App provides basic information, information about availability of parking and fares is not updated.it caused me inconvenience when I reached the station and found no parking facility was there. Please update correct details. Thanks
The new Update is very bad. Very slow and doesn't load. Old App was much better and to the point. Ok now they are not even properly highlighting pink line.
App is too good but all routes of metro is not cover in this app like Aqua line(Noida). If the same is cover in this app then this is the excellent guide of metro lines..
new ui looks great! buttons are responding late though, also, i am seeing every station name twice & the app crashes whenever i click on show route and fare.
Earlier app was much user friendly as compare to latest one. You shuld develop such technology which is easy, hasslefree and easy to undersood by the end user. This app seems to be fail on evey parameter of technology and innovation.

Looks great! but you have add some more features Such as If we search for route between New Delhi and dhansa bus stand. In previous app it ask if you want to go through airport express line. But not in this.
Airport express line is not included and when we go to feedback section, it takes to email with no emailID available. Improve the things instead of deterioration. Hope will be fixed with further updates
It seems this new update has downgraded the app instead of upgrading it. Not able to see the route, longer loading and many more bugs...
New UI is awesome, but app is crashing too much, and has become very slow. I am not able to get route due to buffering
I was using this application from last several years but recent update made it more awful. Please either fix the issue in asap manner or else provide previous version of application. Thanks in advance.
Great app with good info the new ui is crisp and clean. Would love to have a *Arrive by time option* as well like in Google maps. Also station alert is kinda useless.
Please Update And Fix it's Bugs so many changes needed in this new version while we searching destination route and fare app is closed and back to phone home screen so please update this. Last app was so useful and easily accessible but this is so bad üëé Thank u DMRC
The updated version is not working at all, slow as hell and lagging every time ...the previous one was better though simple .
The new update isvery slow, irritating. Please bring back the old version it was simple, fast and efficient.
For the new update all new things are nice But the map system of searching route is missing Also the map is not as per the actual route and directions. Old map was way better

The new version sucks, ui wise this version improved and fabulous but now it become soooo slow and screen stuck.... Please fix this and make it smooth like older version.
I cannot navigate delhi metros without this app. It's design interface is easy to use and intuitive. Very good app!
New update is very nice and good UI. but it's behaving Sluggishly. Cannot check even basic routing.. Bugs to check...
Worst app... After latest application update. The application is performing worst with lots of bug. Last version was very stable and very user friendly.
I'm unable to login in this app from day one, use two different mail id and mobile number but account activation link not received at my both mail id. Is there any facility for login in this app or add features are only for show.
Apps like this can only be useful if updated. This app is not updated and this made us waste long hours going by wrong way and changing multiple lines.
The new app is just super great. Very smooth and informative. The updation was necessary, and it finally happened.
Earlier app was best and quick to load. The new upgrade has made the app useless. The upgraded app doesn't work and gets close by itself. Please rollback to previous version.
great app for getting all about metro route, fare and all means all. just try. only one thing please start the online smart card recharge and facility to block the missing card for avoiding the misuse.
The screens load too slowly in the new app. The loading animation just takes too long while navigating the app.

Its a bit complicated. When the route of metro is shown and different stations are there i thin you should make it bit easier.
App is not working properly after update. it take more time respond and automatically closes after few seconds. This is so disgusting.
saviour app! Edit : changes from 5 to 2 star. it was good. New updates completely ruined the ease of use and utility of this app. Please bring back the old and convenient style.
App is good, but need to be updated for new route/station. After Oct. 2019 some new metro station has open but not mentioned in app. Plz update latest station list.
It is so bad to tell the route on Sunday early morning. It do not tell the way which can help me to reach for my early examination. After reaching the metro i find that train will start at 8. Full useless app.
The app doesn't open. I have reinstalled it at least 5 times but it still refuses to work. Everytime its the same thing, "app stopped working" Terrible and useless app
The travel time you show here are far less then actual time, as per you the changing time for metro is only two min at every interchanging station, you dont consider the waiting time for next train to come while interchanging the train. Instead of accurate time you should rather write minimum and maximum time for journey, especially after 10 pm the waiting time is around 10 min at interchanging station but you only consider it two min and make fool of people downloading this app and following it
Works offline. Performance is really good. Easy to use. New stations are added as and when needed.
What rubbish is this. Why this app start asking for my media storage access. Its not starting without giving permission. I don't find any relevant reason to give my media access to a app which I use only to check metro route.
Its really helpful, infact in i loved new update its easy to interchange as platform no and towards which station you wanna move it tells everything. I loved the new update finally the app is more useful for new person.

New version is very laggy and interface was good but old one is the best don't update the new one or atleast the old one is another option for the user. (OLD OPINION --This app is very usefull ‚ù§Ô∏è)
This app is not working properly and it also very slow to show results.. Previous version is working far better than the current one..
Liked the new interface. But it is bit laggy than than previous version. Overall a very good experience.üëç
Very bad... Previous version was gud there was no need to upgrade to such a laggu and useless version Keeps on loading and takes much time to show the results
It takes alot of time in searching the route and the app is quite slow takes alot of time in working otherwise everything else is fine .
It shows difficult routes i.e where you have to change multiple times . Instead of easy routes. For example: search for hazrat nizamuddin to New Delhi . You can reach New Delhi from nizamuddin just by changing on INA . While it shows longer and a difficult route where you have to change 3 times.
After the update app is slow. Like while searching route it takes 1 or 2 minute but in the previous version it was within seconds.
Why do you really need to update the app older version was to handy to use and easy to understand this was really bad and not user friendly. Designer doesn't have Knowledge about user interface
Guys Aqua line is missing! Also the map feature can be improved to look better! Otherwise great work.
experience has become trash after new update it keeps loading for very long time it was such a simple and good app before now its shows loading all the time can't see anything unless you wait for 5 to 10 mins.

I have never see such a third class app, takes hours to resolve a query, sometimes fare is not shown sometimes no. of station missing, in one word just a poorly designed app.
Facility to view Metro Smart Card balance should be made available on the app ASAP. It's a basic feature that all other major cities' metro apps are already having.
Your app is not updating routes properly. For eg. Now i can go from IGI airport to Lajpat Nagar via Dhaula Kuan bridge which connects airport metro line with pink line but this is still not shown in the route.
Simple and great app for metro commuters, It would be convenient if you can add the platform number too in the "Route between stations"
Interface looks good But aap takes to too much time.. Atleast 40 mint. For loading , If you click any point on apk. Then it takes lot of time again.
App has improved considerably. Very happy with the app user interface. Changed my review after a good experience especially in the last few months.
Previous version was easy to use and fast response rate, it even doesn't require internet to navigate but this new version needs internet every time you search
This app is most horrible. Doesn't work most of the time, since data speed is poor in India. Earlier app was simpler and working well. Who changed it, and why?
Always remains in process when using any feature in app. New version of app is not fast as old version. And why don't you add upi payment option in app to recharge metro card?
It should give all possible routes between 2 different stations so that the traveller can choose the shortest and best route.

Experience is good but I just want to ask DMRC to that when was the gray line Dhansa Bus Stand Station get updated in DMRC App bcz I can face lot of problems. So I request to DMRC to please update the station in your app as soon as possible... Thank you
In evening, all metro trains are of short routes on Violet line. I entered in metro for kashmiri Gate but when it is started then it changes in short routes metro new destination is sarita vihar. So, all pessengers are suffering with this issue.
Please add aqua line in the metro map also.... aqua line is running since long time now and its still not added to the map of ur app.... please add it as soon as possible or u might loose users
While travling a Metro are too time taken. In comparison of metro DTC buses are having better services now a days. Both takes same time now a days. I personally recommend use personal vehicles it is better and best.
Very helpful app but need updates. Aqua line not updated (Sector 137). This app doesn't show the easier routes to reach destinations. please update asap.
All is good but one thing must be in this app that is not at present, this app does not show smart cart balance. Please add this feature for user so that this will help the users to recharge for cards.
This app is crashed again and again whenever I search for any stations, please fix this bugs. I am using realme 2 pro device.
If you are in Delhi and wanted to experience METRO then you should definitely try this. Just enter arrival station and destination station and bingo you will get all the necessary informations. Download it and use if you want a hassle free experience.
Airport Express Line has still not been updated. Rapid Metro information needs to be integrated. First and Last Train times are missing.
it is very helpful it provide full information about the path. but i am rating this app for 4 star because the metro card is never recharged through online process from the app..the develpor should pay focus on the same.

App is not working. Please improve to work. When I fill boarding and destination station then app is automatically off.
Hi Team, This app is crashing while clicking on Show route and Fare. Kindly fix this Bug. My phone is running on Android 12.
You just litterally ruined the app... First one was great and simple... This one is litterally pathetic. And doesnt work properly.. please make this app like before.. because less is more dont try to be fancy.. i have been using it since 2015.. and that experience was great dont try to ruin it please
I edit my review. Because the first is very good but after the update the app is not work properly. Not show anything. Not show route. And app has not customer service.
poor ,providing difcult and long route. totally confusing route showing.I am using another app for same that is giving very simple and clear route. Jhandewalan to kohat enclave I am traveling and I face this problem. while another app is showing very simple and short route.
Very poor performance, slow, poor colors choice & uncomplete information. Very uncomfortable for new passenger's.
Love it ! Very helpful. Please keep updating the app. You need to advertise the app on all the Metro Stations to encourage more people to download it
please update the app..you have new stations and new lines coming up in between.. change the places in the map.. i took the apps tour guide.. looked up jama masjid.. the app showed nearest metro station chandni chowk..so i got down at chandni Chowk and paid hundred bucks to reach jama masjid just to see a station named jama masjid near the actual jama masjid.. please update the tour guide. section. i hope this review goes into the notice of the required team.who forwards this to the developers
Older version was much better. Current app interface is too much advance and complicated to understand. Older one was million ways better than this one
Why would Delhi Metro App require location access for all features. For some features like route between stations x &y, location is not required. Delhi metro should take permission on need only basis only.

It does not show the easy route. e.g.. Keshav Puram to South Ex can easily be done by changing at Netaji Subhash Place and then directly to South Ex. But this app will suggest Keshav Puram to Kashmere Gate then change then go to INA and then again change and finally to South Ex. You should have better algorithms to help the customer.
Using it for the longest time, felt disappointed when found that they have not updated the broken pink line route yet. You can go from welcome to Nizamuddin directly now. Please updated it in your routes.
This is the wonderful app for Delhi Metro. It would let you know the exact Price, exact time & shortest route to be followed moreover it would also let you kniw the nearest metro station available as well the timing of opening & closing of a particular metro station.
Oldest version was good in operating, after getting new update is not working properly and application closes automatically without showing station details.
suggested that the smart card or online facility to be available for tracking the smart card, atleast on optional basis , may be with a premium too. .this can increase income and also increase number of users nd commuters , being a popular and innovative thing
The update that has been made in the app have made it practically useless. The previous one was quite handy, fast and accurate.
Very bad. I recharge my card using this, but shows no conformation of payment. No option to check travel card balance. Submit complaint thorugh this app, again no conformation. What's wrong?
it is better to add platforms so that the passenger is able to find correct direction and cabin. Also add gps assisted location marking.
Still shows old information. Pink line is complete now. It still shows incomplete in between and shows wrong connection from south extension to anand vihar.
I am little bit confused while finding the exact plateform to be used for travelling. I have to check into the map for route metro station. Can i get easy option to know atleast about the towards station name.?

I have one request : Please keep interchangpe time in consideration while calculating minimum time beetween a route. Sometimes the route shown is actually worse if interchange time is considered.
A decent app ruined in the name of update. Nothing loads. Keeps buffering even on good speed data connection.
Old app is better this version is very slow and unable to find any route between 2 station showing only process wrost app.
The new app is taking to Long time to respond and on the show route and fare page only route is showing. It's a good amazingüíïüòç application.
Old version had good user interface after update I'm not able to find routes between two metro stations.
In the effect of the latest update, the app just won't start. It keeps loading and loading again.
Worst app. Can't believe this app is DMRC's official app.. We can reach Naraina Vihar from Mayur Vihar Pocket-1 by not changing any metro from Pink line, But this app tell us to change at Mayur Vihar-1 and again change at Rajouri Garden for Pink line.. We can reach our destination without changing but they are telling us to change twice.. Worst app.
App is too slow , taking too much time to load . Route not showing estimated fare which is vital. Poor testing from team ,Clearly shows pressure of new release on team.
easy to use. shows accurate date. just make sure you always have this updated to reflect latest routes.
The app interface and UI is very good but the app doesn't show the routes. It keeps on loading and no route shows up. Just like a ferrari without wheels. Kya kre iska? Sir pr maare?

The new version is so slow. It takes long time to show route. Earlier version was simple and easy to use.
Unable to sign up. Did not recieve verification in email. Though made ‚Çπ200/- top-up using card number as 'GUEST'. Not sure if it is successful. Do u even exist !!??
For people who need to know about travelling with metro, this App is definitely exceptional and savior! Glad it was developed and as required! Great Job!!
New update has rendered this application absolutely useless. All I can see is loading circle after I enter source and destination. Fire your IT team behind this application's development.
app has improved considerably. Very happy with the app user interface. Changed my review after a good experience especially in the last nine months.
I liked the app before and it was very helpful for me but now u have changed it. It should be more helpful for ur customers but it's not. And u made this app hectic to use. I request you to show a simple and helpful route showing app for ur customers.
While navigating, if we choose not to opt a route through violet line, it still assigns route through violet. Kindly fix it.
It would be great if you could add the major food courts present on different stations in the metro app.
Update the sunday timing of the metro from noida electronic city to city centre metro station. I saw the first metro was at 6am in app but when reached got to know that it's from 8 am So, it needs to be corrected in the app
Just add one more thing in this app. User can get details the Last Metro on that root where he wants to go, So that he can easily know at which metro he have to choose on station.

Amazing application, great UI, really helped me find my way on the metro... Keep up the good work...
Though initially a good app for newbies to Delhi metro or otherwise but why no updates esp pink line.. Trilokpuri station is still not updated due to which showing several interchange .. Pl update more frequently both the route and fares..
The upgrade version is asking for permission to access the pictures and other media in phone. Unable to understand the requirement...
Metro routes are not updated, it cost me more time because of this stupid app. Even if they said that they updated app but it didn't show updated route.
It has all the features that were expected. A Big time saver, very useful. Mindblowing!
I recharged my metro card using this application, amount deducted from my account and there was no amount in Top up. How we can check recharge history of card ??? is mising.
The app while calculating time to travel between 2 stations must also take into account the average time it takes one to change a metro which actually varies from station to station & line to line
great app to select and check out the best routes possible for a metro station . over this, the estimated time for required for a journey helps to plan a schedule
The map is really awesome. Mostly 80% of the informations can be judged by looking the map only.. Great work team.
Please move back to the older version, what have you made this app into. Earlier it was so smooth to use now I can't search anything it just keeps on searching and then I have to close the app.

App needs updates on so many levels. Read/Update metro card via NFC being the first like Chennai Metro RaiLtd (CMRL) app does. Make maps real time with train timings & tracking of any/all trains.
The worst experience I ever had with Dmrc is with payments and customer services. If you make a payment online and some reasons payment not reflected due to their server problems. It takes 15 days to get that money refunded and you will not get any confirmation for your refund. The worst, pathetic experience always in public sectors. Due to govt. Thappa they think that we are above everyone. So frustrating.
In previous app, the mobile numbers of all metro stations were given but in the new app it doesn't have the numbers. Kindly include them .
its previous version was much better than thisone. If we search for any route b/w two stations, it gives no information.
after updating the app, play store shows - "You've already installed this app". I don't know if the updates was successful or not!!
To slow while searching. Only a circle rotates all the time. In fact I will complete my journey before it's search result.
The first version was lot more clearer and easier to use. We got information we needed to in easy way.
Very easy to use
Can you add short route because when i see in some other app they sometime show 2 routes for one destination with same start point.
Worst app totally! I doubt on DMRC about your hiring to build this bad and low performance app. Searching operations are very low performance. You can't access the results within seconds.

Not able to see station information by clicking on a station name (error: Delhi Metro Rail has stopped). Please look into this issue. App version: 4.8 Android version: 7.0 Device: Moto G5 Plus
There was absolutely no need for any update, with update following problems arised 1. Loses its simplicity 2. Lacks the speed Please restore the previous version.
Pink line broken link not updated. It is showing wrong information between routes Even after 17 aug update (I Don't know what has been updated) it is still showing wrong information for pink line
Too much loading... You can find faster if you use google.. old update was thousand time better than this... Please make this app more smoother, faster, and make it offline as well...
Essential app! Shows the route between station. Simple and very useful.
Older version is much better than new update, in new update its taking too much loading time...... Hope you are fixing this issue faster.else you are going to lost many users...
The new update made the app very laggy. The app has serious optimization issues and is no way faster in load time than the previous version I hope the app will improve
Good. Excellent if all metro station are added and exit point shown on map. Kindly include gurgaon and greater noida metro station information Metro app showing four gate of ‡§Ü‡§à‡§Ü‡§à‡§ü‡•Ä metro station But in actual only three gate. Please correct this information
Helpful application with a lot of information. Please update it to latest version with name changes of some stations. Thanks.
App is getting Crash repeatedly. When clicking on search route, it is getting closed.

Upgrade the app. Have a user friendly interface. Include feature to check card balance. Refer to Hyderabad metro rail app.
Only used this app for seeing routes and it can't even do that now. App always crashes whenever I try to search for a route.
within location access permissions app will not work. what? abe q du mai location access? you just tell route info, thats it. jyada udo mat. uninstalling.
After the new update this application is choke whenever I started its take too time but pervious was so fast and also when I searched destination and enter the button automatically the app is close...
Some metro stations are not shown in the app... For example.. "Pari Chowk" Please update your app. I just missed my exam because of your lack of awareness.
I've had a great experience with this app...but the app has not yet been updated to newer stations for the aqua line plz update itüôèüôè.
super app.....a passenger from out side of Delhi NCR can easily search his/her destination, time, charge and from where have to change different lines of particular route...... so best app for self navigation... Vishal......Socialist
Map not updated... Update the map...!!
Useless application. Do u care to update various information required for safe and smooth travel for the passengers on resuming services after lockdown.
Previous app was good , that was opening quickly. New app is not opening quickly. Font is also not visible.

The Official App is always better than 3rd Party App. It would be great if the UI is upgraded or developed more. Thanks to DMRC.
"Search by address" option doesn't work at all for finding nearest metro. Please fix this; else this app is useless for me.
This app really help me to find my destination. It's always helpful to use metro in city but if you know the right route of metro so thanks to dmrc for such a helpful app.
DATED 15-10-2019,WHEN I ENTERED THE METRO GATE THAN THE GATE ARE CLOSED MY BAG WAS STUCK BETWEEN THE METRO GATE & AFT GATE ,AND THE METRO STARTED TO RUN,MY BAG WAS THERE BETWEEN THE GATE ONLY AND BEFORE THE STATION GOT ENDED MY BAG STRIP WAS BROKEN AND THE BAG FELL DOWN THE TRACK, I put some quest 1.If there is a present of child or week man instead of bag same time,than there is a open Invitation of a big accident, 2.METRO Sensor didn't work than my bag was stuck between AFT and METRO GATE.
The new update is worse. It keeps lagging and not even showing properly. Please bring the old feature back. P.S Not every update is necessary.
Great application!! However, please update to include the latest map, I cant see Aqua line.
All metro details available. We can calculate cheap fare and less time for destination and save too much time. This app is ocean of Delhi Metro
The new user ui/ux is very bad, it takes 2-3 minutes of time to load the app, when connected to internet, offline working is good
Very nice interface and nice feature Like interactive map, fare, Route , first and last metro time.
Nice app .. But it doesn't show which platform no. we have to go to after an interchange . This makes things a little confusing

Interface is nice but new update is not working fine. When I search the route it automatically close the app
Previous map was much better than this updated version,it takes alot of time to load .. so much latency in the app
Contact numbers of metro stations are not available.kindly make them available like earlier they were. Contact Numbers are very helpful in Urgency/Emergency
After Last update, Now app is working fine. Everything looks good. UI is extremely excellent. Thanks for the update....
New App is poor enough , It is not responding & if it responds , it doesn't show all information as old application shows , Kindly revert back to old UI & database as such this new update SUCKS
Pretty good effort from Delhi Metro Rail Corporation. The UI needs refining. But at least its a start. Kudos!
The earlier version was far better.The least team could have done was to give the correct timings of first and last metro at stations in place of making people miss them.
The new updated version sucks. Please bring the old version back. It was very easy and convenient to use.
Most of the details regarding metro timings, washroom, lift , parking, fare etc. are available. Easy to use.
Very useful app for getting each info like route info, no of stations , fare, distance , etc about your ride in delhi mtero.

I've noticed a mistake in the map, naraina vihar metro station is underground but the app shows its elevated. please correct it for the convenience of users
This new updated app sucks, takes forever to show station routes. The old app was way faster. Anyway to revert to the old one?
Finally, complete makeover of app after many years but there is false news i.e toilet accessibility is free. 2nd- give option to check card balance also.
Not showing all the lines.. old data updated. showing the longer routes. Poor!
UI looks drastically good now and app is running pretty fast as compared to the old one. Kudos üëç
Good app. There must be option of selecting from map. It will be good of have alternate route option.
Everything is fluent in UI, features rich environment. I have a request for your developer, Please add upcoming tracks in map. üôè
it's very helpful application although some details while changing lines should be added, like platform number and station name where the train is heading.
App doesn't work if i charge station between they not give any reply. Old metro map is goood this app does not work badllyy updatingüòåüòåüò≠
The app was user friendly but after updating it not giving the the same experience. Make it easy and smooth

it's really helpful and manageable app. The best thing is that it works without internet as well. Really made my life convinient at Delhi.
The new update is pathetic. Not only in terms of UI but also in terms of UX. I am in the Mobile Apps business and I wonder how and who allowed this new version to roll out.
This is useful App . While travling metro find station and details of each station and distance of each station. I'm to appericated Delhi metro rail app.
The old version was better than from new version. And new version takes more time for finding a route.
Good for information and find out yr plateform, price, time....
Perfect app for travelling in Delhi Metro Station üëçüëç
When the new Aqua line is inaugurated, why the route is not added in the app. pleas do the same. Thanks.
Suggestion: It would be better if you show the "going to" direction or last station name on results displayed by "routes between" option.
Gives route information, first and last timing for the station it also works without internet. using it for a long time.
This app is very helpful, I was travelling in Delhi for the first time which first seems to be so difficult but this app will greatly help u to reach your destination..works even offline.

this is not right, im so disappointed and disturbed see the new interface i was happy See the new logo after click on the app i can't understand how to search and see My route esliy ,Pls Fix this,
First train and last train details is not showing.
Whenever I search station details it crashes. The updated version is worst performance.
If u need just metro route then this app is ausom hope they add which gate to choose to get desired destination as getting out of metro from wrong side/gate is very confusing
Issue is new update doesnt load properly app. I am trying to open app from past 20 min and its still loading tried resetting data also of app still its loads.
I love this it's very easy and gives accurate information. Heartly thanks from my side to the provider who provides us this app and makes our ride easy....
User interface can be better. Looks like it's designed by some final year B.Tech student for project work.
really useful app and most of people use it also üòäüòä. but in this app ü§îü§îalso provide platform no. of interchange so that it help more of the people.
Sir pls update first and last train section of the App It is showing this section is under updation since last 2 months
After updating to latest version , it gets slowed and taking too much time for responding. Very worst upgradation.

Very helpful application, gives- station information, fare info, route between stations, nearest metro station. Also metro map available. üëç
This is the best app for all information about to delhi metro. Best feature is #nearest metro my location..üëå. Love this app and give 5 starsüòç pure ad. free no bug no leg. Free size app.... Thank u so much #Delhi metro app developer great jobüëç
The app is not updated..the pink line is connected now.. but it shows disconnected and shows the longer route
This is worst updating of this new app of dmrc. The updated app only buffering not showing immediate results as previous version of same.
New update has a lot of glitches. It lags alot and when I enter the date then app crashes too.
Ticket issuer gave short change :-( I did not check exact fare and he (issuer at Rajiv Chowk) charged me more fare than actual. Also the fare display screen was off (intentionally or not I don't know) But felt cheated :-(
It's a Very Great App and I am going many places lots by this app is helping me. Helping me For cheaper Travelling and Correctly time I reached the destination on timely.
After update the app is alot slower than any usual app It takes alot of time to search any metro station. So much disappointed
It's good app which tells about fare and timing between two stations... Specially, Helpful for those who remains outside of Delhi or first time travellers..
Thanks üëç Very nice app update. we were waiting. Only lines me from-to switch nahi ho raha hai. And give us smart card balance, recharge and view last 25 transaction facility also

Hello DMRC, new features and UI looks really amazing, expecting Card recharge integration in the same app
Earlier it was very good app but now it's Super slow; takes more than a minute to show the route result.
Very poor update. Saw on friend's mobile smartphone. So am sticking to old version for now in which Trilokpuri is still not connected with Shiv Viharüòãüòú but i can manage that.
Fantastic App! However, please update it, include the aqua line also in the route maps.
excellent app. I'm very thankful to the team who makes this kind of app. Helps me a lot when i was in delhi. Again words can't describe my thankfulness.
This is a very 3rd class application for visually impaired persons. This application do not work with accessibility TalkBack
I have found wrong information about nearest merto station and many more. New updatedated app is very slow comprision to old version app.
A lot of work can be done on it. However as it is now, it's functional and answers most of it queries. Good job DMRC
Great app for commuting in and around the city of Delhi, if you are new and want to hover around the city at a very affordable price, then download this app for knowing the network.
Very good experience with this new app, UI/UX are so awesome, and information is also available within second.

This updated version takes alot of time while searching anything and has become so complex too. Last version was way better and simpler than this.
Hello Delhi metro Please one option want to add on application Now iam travelling in metro I want live location from to my destination and your all metro station name audio want to say here on application please this one option want to add this one is help for non educated and village people's please iam waiting please complete this process fast.. Sorry for mistakes my pronunciation correct and understand please..
This app works but lacks lot of information. For eg, it doesn't tell you towards which side one needs to go to reach it's destination..
Delhi Metro made the application too clumsy. Forgot that the users of the application are from all age groups who might not be that comfortable while using the application.
App is crashing and taking too long to give information. Previous version was way better. Please fix this
When you travel in Delhi metro it's really a great puzzle for searching stations and other things but by this app it's all become easyüòä loved it.‚ù§Ô∏è
The route not up to date. Exp. Pink line route is not completely correct. Need to be improve.
Still need to improve as it shows only one route for journey where as all the options should be shown and let the commuter choose his way.
The Pink route is still not connected after updates. Therefore app shows larger route when small route is available.
There are serious mistakes in routes. Not friendly, appealing interface. Eg: Okhla Vihar - Shiv Vihar 4 change overs through different lines. It can be gone with 2 ch ov.

Took DMRC team 3-5 updates to fix the glitch in the newly launched app. Good work, Map could have been of a better looks.
There should be an option to pin your home station so that you don't have to enter it everytime use the app.
Earlier interface was better to use, it takes too much time to load the map!!
The app is not updated properly and the shortest distance & interchange are coming incorrectly.
As a first time visitor,this app was a life saver for me with accurate guidance,helped me to save my time effectively.
Previous version of map was better than the current version in some roots presently metros are operating but not shown in map
Worst experience after update, App not even open correctly now. It is very slow now. Used to be very good
Using from long time. It helped a lot but no updates from long time. Pink line update is not there.
The pink line route has not yet been updated . This causes lot of problems. Please update it immediately.
Does not works offline and even with good internet takes forever to find a route. Why are you guys downgrading your app.

After recent upgrade Colour aren't properly visible. There seems No difference between Pink and Red line Colour. Improve this.
This updated version app not give me information properly ....kindly pls fixed it as soon as possible .. Destination route is not working properly..
I had earlier given it 5 stars but......due to non updataion of app, especially the pink line route not updated. Could be more useful and informative app.
Some bugs found... everytime i have to enter destination details and it takes a some time to open route everytime
What an User Interface if somebody using first time then how many difficult situation that person face.....searching for station to destination station....app is not working....It is really Govt of India app....we know goi website doesnot works but now GOi fingured playstore by this type of application....Who stopped working after searching price orr station.....Gu hi khaoge bc corrupted logo
please update your app, as it is showing wrong info. i am going from ashram to shakoorpur and the app says the route has 1 interchange but there is direct pink line, no interchange needed.
Good app for travel
Card Recharge process service very poor not open from 7days
Under updation always
very good and help me alot

Please improve the application..
Good experience with this app
Barcode should be bigger
No aqualine map mentioned in it.
Overall good experience
This is a good service
Worst update. Time complexity of this apps is infinite. Please make it clean and fast and provide offline search.
Very helpful app üëç
Since the new update, the app keeps crashing as soon as I click on 'show route & fare'.
Takes too much loading time and not shows fair with the route as it showed without upgrade to app. Not happy.

Very bad update. Earlier i find location which i want are simple and easy . But this update in very confusing and complicated
This app is really very good, without providing your personal details to this app u can easily travel anywhere in delhi with this app with accurate information.. whenever I come to Delhi I must use this app ...I just love this app.. thanks to developer ‚ù£Ô∏è
This is very good and helpful app. Delhi metro Rail it locate station for you and gives you timing when you train arrives and when you have to reach station.
Good Application, user friendly easy to use it's provide me the right route and time ,by using this it is very easy to stay in delhi for me
Older app version was best this one continuously not working properly and not showing any information. Highly depressed
Previous Version was Perfect and Fast App. 5 stars for previous version, new version not very useful, its very slow 2 stars for new version
Srvice alert app feature is Good addition. üëçüáÆüá≥üáÆüá≥üáÆüá≥üáÆüá≥üáÆüá≥üáÆüá≥üáÆüá≥üáÆüá≥
Why is recharge screen looking like desktop webpage????
Scanning this app with VirusTotal gave the result as Android/FakeCop.NH!tr which is a spyware.
Not able to download it from play store. Download stuck at 99%.. all other apps are working fine.

Best app for metro routes information
Good work 2 route showing this app
All is perfect butcrash problem there n!!
I am very happy to uas this amazing app. I love it.
Best app for delhi metro but Aqua line ko bhi include kijiye
Where is latest update metro station noida sector 50 root not added on this.
Very useful great work apps owesome
No option to check balance or to recharge metro card. Interface is not user friendly.
Since a week ago, the metro frequency is 5mjnutes even in morning time from arjangarh metro station. It's getting problem and time consuming during office hour. Kindly look into this matter and resolve it ASAP so that public shouldn't wait more time at station and they also not get problem due to the crowd . Please . It's a humble request.
Exceptional app for delhi metro, very user friendly and easy to navigate to the information.

Previous version of app was very good, after update it got very slow. I am unable to see the route
app doesn't work keeps crashing and sometimes gets into bootloop. please check.
it's really very helpfull for metro users. It's information is also very accurate about metro rout.
this app is very helpful for new comers and also out station pepoles.my journey was very pleaser in dehli.i would like to come again and again here .
Earlier version was good enough, I was using from last 4 years. Currently, it is pathetic. Compelling me to use another app for delhi metro.
Poor App, just showing single route, no options of different routing and fare with expected time on different routes.. even route given is not shortest in time, many times more time consuming
Very nice & easy to use for everyone. More or less this app is very HELPFUL FOR THOSE WHO NEED TO KNOW THE TRAIN ROUTES.
very bad experiece after i update yesterday night.and this app keep going crash and stop working and get back to home screen...üòíüòíüòíüòí
very helpful DMRC I'm currently using this app now, but do not download Delhi metro ncr app they don't have complete route in map no complete pink line though they r good too.
please add the new aqualine route sir,as this route is still missing from the all metro route and fair as well is not added.Thank You.

New look is really great, I hope it's works like before. Ui was but works like a charm I hope it's continue doing that, Everything is smooth af nowüî•
Such a useless app. After update the app, not able to check anything. Roll out the update.
Worst app i must say Too many bugs Not working if a person is hurry I used to face the issue in emergency but worst experience üôèüôè
After new update it's running very slowly Please correct the user interface also taking too much time to show any information.
Bring back the older version please or release it under some other name. It was way better than this mind numbingly slow app.
This app is final for metro related information, all the info you need is available here in a single app. I loved it.
Online service is not working. Even online recharge is not load and open How I can recharge my Smart card. It ridiculous please Improve your service.
This app needs to be more responsive and clear as the icons are much smaller.... otherwise it's the app worth to keep üëåüèº
Add card and balance check option is still missing, so I can check my balance easily and recharge my card with in app.
The app is crashing whenever i check routes and fares. Please fix it otherwise the app is unusable.

Previous version was way better than this. This version is crashing again and again. Not a good updation.
This updated version is worst, it is taking lot of time to open. Requires lot of patience. Before update it nice
It is too good aap and who's first time travel in the metro for that person very very useful app. .
Good app, except it doesn't always tells you the best route. I have to rely on the map to find the best route.
Dear Delhi Metro Rail after the new updates your app is not working properly, the previous one was good. Please fix the issues in this new app.
Previous edition of the app was so much better No complications just plain sabha simple application New app keeps crashing is inaccurate and just terrible in general
Absolutely brilliant new update. Much better user experience now. Easy and user friendly new look.
I always used but some small feedback if possible. Please provide plateform which pick 1 or 2 . Always find plateform and ask to someone .like where is my train app
App is not working properly. It stopped every time I checked the station detail. A waste...
Awesome experience... Jst follow up the instructions platform no. And colour line.. And it's completely a ludo game.. A must recommended one

Do more publicity of this app. Everyday I travel in metro one or the other person is asking about how to reach one station or the other but doesn't know about thia app.
Good update as compared to last app, but lots of improvements required, station contact number not showing in current update
Since the update, no results are shown, it just keeps on loading and loading.
Old version was way too simple and easy to use. This new update sucks ! Where can i download the older version ?
Worst App. No live timing and routes. No proper information like what is station number while changing station. No live update.
Why majlis park to shiv vihar route not updated? Also if I search stations from saket to anand vihar ,the app suggests going all way to central sec change to blue line and then to ANVT. This is much longer route compare to what time it takes on pink line.
Wonderful app but it has not updated yet when I tried to go somewhere by metro it was showing interchange bit there was no interchange
App is running VERY SLOW since this new update. Please fix this problem. Previous version was much better.
As soon as I search for any route, the app closes. Would be great if this issue is resolved.
This is the best app. Dont install any other app for this purpose. Just use this. No ads. No lagging. No extra space required.

It was really very easy to get relevant metro train without asking anyone.... Request - please add details for Greater noida metro that has just started ..
What is use of app even if you can't check the DMRC METRO CARD Balance, status of card. I think such options must be given. Overall ok
Old version was simple and easy to use. New version taken time so much If possible change it into old version.....
Very nice appüëç
After updation of this app.. I am not getting any results(Route). Previous version was too good.
Earlier it was good but now it stopped working, every time I open this and choose a route it forced closed the app.
Worst version of dmrc. Not even responding. Continuous showing error error error. Will not give even one star.
It is not being installed. It downloads 99% and no further option just to cancel.
suggested routed are not the best ones. there isnt any option to check alternative routes.
Please we need older version. This version is very complicated and also too much time taking

Best app, With each and every information about metro station, travel timing, fare etc.
The Previous version of the App is much better than of this upgraded version App services. Not working properly.
Update the map and route.It get confuse to the customer when they search the route through your app.Pink line has been completed.
Ruined a very simple app with the updates. Why did you even add a time to search bar? Keep it optional!
After so many updates app is working fine so nice interface and fast process like the multiple options for interchange and look
Simple and good UI, asy to use, works in offline mode as well.
Update is not so bad but the complexity has increase make it a bit difficult to use. Please add indication for Noida metro and if possible please add Noida metro route too. It would be helpful for the commuters.
Appreciate!! the job Done But interchanging platform should be Clearly shown so that it would be much easier.
Very good transportation system . I travelled many places in Delhi without problem. Time maintained always.
Content is good but working very slow. Taking lot of loading time after pressing any link.

Aqua line is not displayed in the app. Otherwise helpful app for quick navigation around NCR.
I love the experience of this app. Whenever i get stuck about the route, i choose this app and find my way.
Previous version was too good.....app is crashing everytime on clicking the 'Show Route & Fare'
Instead of watch2pay by LAKS, Delhi metro should explore Samsung / Iphone for smartwatch tickets. These smartwatches support NFC technology..apple smartwatch has also come out with storing chip informations of simcards in their smartwatches through e-sim technology.
the DMRC app needs an overhaul. Consider this: Route - Mayur vihar pkt 1 to igi App says: Rs.80, 56mts, 4 interchanges. Better option: M.V pkt 1 to s.campus interchange to d.k for igi. Rs60,41mts,1interchange. Plus app doesnt show discounted rates for cardholder
Firstly Can't find the best route for the journey. Secondly aqua line route is not updated.
Pahle to v chal rha tha, avi to o v band ho gaya. Every time I try to start the app, its just loading. Not opening properly.
Please update name of Noida City Center as Wave City Center, as it's little confusing in location.
Really excellent app. I Suggest all very user-friendly app Great great Delhi metro. Very easy to use.
All conclusions solve hare. Awesome platform for delhi metro service. This app provides important information for us like fare, direction, platform no., Direction etc. Thanx DMRC

tour guide is not working
This app is taking long time and today this app not showing station names when i select mohan nagar to laxmi nagar route... Old delhi meteo app is good. Simple and fast. üôèüèª
really nice app for a delhiite or for a new person coming to delhi. almost every details are available on the app related to metro. KUDOS to DMRC
Update was a screw up, not everyone is hesitant on using data , we want smoother interface
The app doesn't shows the route of aqua line. It should also be updated in the app.
No need to revamp UI and confuse users. Really hate current map and a lot of things
Every thing is working fine except pink line route is not updated. To search info like Welcome to Lajpat Nagar, it is not showing pink line route. Kumar Vikash
Very insightful. Loaded with information about exit gates, feeder buses, train timings and local tourist spots
Route and route map is not yet updated, otherwise app is very useful.
The latest version is crashing too much. Old was better. Atleast it was working.

Good app ,gives right info ,but it should add some more info such as tips how to change metro line .
The isn't working and even the route map is not coloured... The update has gone for a toss.
Everytime app crashes when I click on name of metro stn to get its info i.e. First Train timing, Last Train timing etc.
Size of this app is too large Nd the second thing is that it works very slow
Janakpuri west is not being picked up as a valid station. In fact, only janakpuri south appears when janakpuri is searched. Pl correct/ update the software.
This updated version is not at all functional. Kindly roll back to the earlier version
The app runs really smooth. And there are zero ads as such.
Best for Delhi metro
New app version takes long time to display any content, also not able to show details. Pathetic üòÇ
I download the application everytime whenever traveling to Delhi. Excellent.

Please think to add live metro running status for better customer experience the we never standing 5-10 minutes in station
Fabulous Updateüëåüëåüëå it is very easy to travel in metro when we have this app and also work on update about booking metro tickets in the app üëçüëçüëç
UI has improved significantly. Feels great to use the app. Wonderful.
The older is very convinent and ease to use I also installed it in my fone but after this update delete it. Thank u
Same App crushing issue last version on search route than done and app crush. Please immediately fix this problem.
Very helpful app for a man who travels metro in first time and didn't know abbot metro routes. Great app‚úåüèª‚úåüèª‚úåüèª
It used to be best, but now can't find nearest metro station by entering address no matter what you keep the radius
very good helper and always very useful. As it is offline so very helpful and eaay to use.
You should update the app to the latest as there is no mention of aqua line in the app but it has been build. Please do the needful
I'm using this app for 2yrs and never face a single issue.but this new version never open in time if open still not work properly üò†üò†

This app is very slow...
Pervious App was much better then this one. Much harder to find the route. Not satisfied at all.
The new update is worse...older version was much easy to use and didn't need internet all the time...
Nice application made by DMRC
This app is outdated, Noida sector 52 has got extension - (aqua line) sector 51 and so on- which is not shown by this app. This is misguiding the people. Please update it.
Old version was the best, but these version are worst. Confusing, Very difficult to use.
Works okay. Needs improvement. Could show the train schedule at particular stations.
The first and last train option search always timeout and hardly fetch result. Rest is fine.
First time used this app Nothing is updated I almost missed my train because of wrong time shown in the app Also supreme court is not mentioned in the route. Update the app so better in future I'll or someone give you better review.
Nearest station seach by address should be option to select destination metro station.. currently it showing only nearest boarding station.. searching for nearest destination metro is still challenge

Very good and useful app. Very helpful to find routes, metro Details.
Selecting Route via Airport Express Line (Yes/No option), stalls on a S8. Unimaginable.
Very very Fantastic Improvement DMRC. Thank u. If Possible Add DMRC metro Card recharge facilities in this app and Parking avilable place locator add also..
This updated app not good as comparison to previous one. Previous was awesome, never going to suggest someone. Thanks
This app not working properly, take long time for every execution, also crash mostly....fix it
Previous version was so good.... It was user friendly... This version isn't good in anyway as compare to last one....
App is disgusting as it is not showing a straight route (Pink Line) between Mayur Vihar Pocket 1 to Netaji Subhash Place. Its showing routes through Violet and Yellow lines.. Atleast get the basic n straight routes updated.
Please get back to the older version or get the new one fixed as it is taking too much time and also no details shared
Worst app.dont show full detail in case we have to change metro.it doesn't show ,which side metro we have to take
What sort of update is this..??! Pink line route is not updated, please update the app. Updating it october and still pink line not uodated .i think i should write a mail to anuj dayal for this

There must be information on app that which station have washroom facilitiy in the premise of station. * AND DO WE NEED TO EXIT OR NOT TO USE THE FACILITY.
The DMRC app is one of the best app to travel Delhi without confusion, & without asking the route to anyone. It helps me too much in last week as I was new in Delhi.
This is not a good application.Bugs are that it is not open.It is not easy to book ticket.I request everyone that this application Don't do it to him.
Used to work great but since the latest update it has been crashing everything i enter my destination..... please fix it asap
Why did you change this...Old version was even better. Can you please bring the old one...that was very easy to use.
One of the worst app after new update. It takes forever to show the results.
Ols app was working perfectly fine. Udated app is hanging and takes more time in processing.
Overall its not working...opening but if u search anything getting crashed and closed.
Easy to use and easy to understand ..being new to Delhi. This app makes its very easy to board metro
This is the best delhi metro app!!

What a horrible and pathetic app, it has become after update. Whether motive to update was that no one should use this app as if will keep processing only.
very beautiful design. easy to understand.. everything about delhi Metro in this small app. thanks developer...
The new map of this update is a nightmare. I have uninstalled it and will download old version from internet
Very poor update, it was much better previously and now takes too much time and incomplete information
I love this app, whnvr i used the delhi metro then this app help me alots to find out the correct stations, amount and timings.
Overall good app except the estimated time to travel is very far from actual estimated time.
the user agreement that u click ok to use the app basically says that the dmrc is not responsible for any virus in the app and its not their fault if the app is crappy and useless or if the data is incorrect why bother giving an app then
Good services and accurate information available. But I will request you to develop a online system for remotely checking DMRC metro card balance (APP/website).
UI looks good, but route between station feature is not working.
Worst update ever..old map and information was good..can't even make out the route or anything.

Route should show the destination station of the metro aswell. Not everyone knows metro towards which station they should catch
Despite of recent App update, pink line route is not corrected. Despite of metro operation, map still shows a GAP between Mayur Vihar and Trilok puri
It's been 6 months since trilokpuri to Mayur vihar pink line metro been started but haven't updated in the app. Atleast keep the app updated
Easy to check the route and station details.. love it.. please promote this app so that more people can use it
This app keep on Stucking at 99% while downloading. Other application are able to download easily.
Great app but little ticketing is required. Looking for Map to be made more easy.
its an awesomely developed app... no bugs no ads just simple yet informative... ü§©ü§© great work team....
it is not updated from time to time sometimes it didn't show sortest route but for fair and information
The version befor this was good but now the app freezing and the app is too heavy , I can't understand why, note: I have samsung 21

You have ruined this app. Previous version was so good that I used it for more than 5 years. Please gives us back that previous versions
This app is totally useless....it was anyways showing long route earlier now it's worse because pink line is not updated

Very easy to know the rout .How to change and reach your destination and the rate
App isn't supporting dark mode. Content is not visible during dark mode feature of phone.
It isn't download able stuck at 97% for more than 8 hours
Worst experience after updating the app. Not opening the app. It was good before.

The latest version is like hell totally messed up with it üò°older version is far better and convenient
Veri good application
nice app... all details are mentioned in this app. and it's very helpful and easy to use... must download. without second thought
App is force closing whenever I try to search any route. Graphics are amazing
convenient to check all lines and newly added stations with fares and travel time.
Please update the latest patch. Still pink line is showing incomplete...rest the app is good.
Its now worst after its updation. Before its simple & easy. Its easy to use web version now than this app.
App was awesome for people's who travel in delhi metro but update this app regularly time to time about all the details.
Very nice app. Great UI and updated maps. Nicely demonstrated the routes of Metro.

App unable to open since new UI, from 23 Feb 2022. Tried uninstalling and install.. still issue
overall good app. but please add if there is toilet available in the station information section
Totally usesless app. One can't even check the card balance on this app. What else is this for ?
This app shows too much interchage. Places in shame line should not show any interchange.
App should show all possible options for route and where the gates are existing towards.
Well Fare information is not updated. No app update is there to download. No use.
it's very helpful app for traveling in metro root dedicated and tell the correct fare of tickets and show no. of stops and interchange l
Best app! Please update the platform information also.like arrival and departure of train
App.is very informative.......improve the ui.....make it clean and simple Edit: Now the app interface is clean and smooth
App is very helpful bt it always shows wrong route whenever I search through pink line please update metro map because pink line is connected

Slow version. Older version was much better and more user friendly.
In new updates.... distance is not showing ( in km) ...... please update with this concern..... üòä
This is a very wonderful application.this application is very fast service and good work.me and my friend use the application.very useful application.
Older version was easy-to-use but now it takes more time and more complicated
It's showing wrong information of nearest metro station through GPS. There should be option for recharge .
awesome application but there should be option to search venues by location of user to visit and also share route option to other social apps
After lal quila no station is showing... app got crash after tapping the search button... worse update...
This app just crashesh in my low end device the moment I try to search for my train route whilst other apps work perfecrly fine
This new app is very slow previous version was faster than this and ui is also a bit confusing
Best for those person they use metro first time.

No full information on the app it only show some lines aqua line metro not avlaible on the app.
Gud experience.Every time it hepls me. Easy to find every route or stations, platform also.
I was using this app for so long No doubt before update this app was just amazing and so simple and easy to use but don't know why they update the app and make it worst there is no need of the update.
best app for know everything about delhi metro like fare,Route,tourist places near by metro station etc.
This app experience is awesome but I'm giving 2 star's because I'm unable to view the map always
First metro timings are incorrect. Was barely able to reach the examination centre on time. Kindly correct them so that no one suffers in future
After update it's not showing other routes it's showing only one route previously it's showing all routes
New app is buggy and doesn't display any routes between station.
It is a good app for school and college students and also good for office going people
It's so useless....new routes are not updated even after months of being operational

Sorry this version is little difficult & confusing for new passengers.The previous app was more comfortable
There is fraud going in metro. Ticket distribution charge you more money by fooling you and in hurry you don't check for exact price of tickets. Check the fare before buying tickets
Today I uninstalled app because after update it's getting worst and so slow. No need these kinds of App anymore.
To much time taken to show route,it keep on thinking of root for 15 min, then crashed.
The update is awesome and easy to find any location on the metro map It's really awesome Loved It ü•∞ü•∞
Since the update, whenever I click "show route and fair" button the app crashes
Bring Back the older version, it was much faster & easier to use.
Pls update the app with the Facility to check metro smart card balance. It is the need of the time
Lots of bugs üêû ...... I am trying to find metro between shahdara and rajouri garden But app stuck 4 times but no result
very nice app for commuting I could reach my test centres very easily by commuting via metro using the app.

DMRC app is good and helpful but it shows long route from one side to another side..
App not working, only processing reflecting during any search or app crashed again & again.
Please update to previous version that was so simple to use. The new version of app is not easy to use.
Don't use metro if you need to go office or any official work because metro is not worthy for time frame.
Poor performance working slow after update. Old version was much better but now Dmrc app disappoint very bad poor performance
app doesn't show fastest route or alternative routes for same destination.
Please add Aqua Line to the Map. It would be the best metro app then.
Current update is not good earlier version was better we can not switch route for same destination
New update is not at all good the app is running very slow and also not able to check platforms number now
The worst metro service ever .....train are getting late forever....each train literally stops at every station for more than 5 mins

Very very very metro BAD service in travel after 10'o'clock.please don't travel after 10'o'clock.
It's very very useful for those who dont know much more about metro routes. I love it üòç
Too good to use, but QR system for normal metro should be in the option also, Only Airport Line could use QR code
New update is not working. It stuck everytime I search. Bring back the older version
This is not completely updated it is not showing all the metro stations
Now you need fille/photos permission for no reason. App was simple and best and the latest update ruined it.
After Update it's not working... When i click on Route it's automatically close app
Good Metro app to guide you all your required information except train frequency timing where metro run fir two different routes for eg Bahadurgarh City to Kirti nagar and Bahadurgarh City to Inderlok.
Superb app for metro in Delhi... Everything explained very well and in easy way... Thanks.

New app is crashing continuously. Needs to be rectified.
good app. App should also have option to select available route.
No aqua line!! It's not under DMRC but for people you can add it in your app so that it will ease our lives.
It always respond as an error while searching for nearest metro station.

App is not working at all. When I search the route the app just closes down.
Station information not showing phone number of the SCR of the respective station in new app... New app taking more time to open... pls update it
Information on Noida Metro is not available. Atleast there should be an option to reroute to nmrc website. Online Recharge option still opens desktop website. Mobile browser compatible website should be developed.10% of space can be used for ads for revenue generation
The worst app the old version was very well this updaye has make us very dissapointed.this is very slow
Easy to use and find out the route for metro and you can recharge your metro card also
Please add other facilities & shops available at every stations And also which metro station is near to important to places in delhi , exam centers etc
